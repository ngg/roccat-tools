  * roccateventhandler
  
    A eventhandler that takes care of displaying OSD events and handles
    quicklaunching and talk events.

  * Icons and sounds
  
    These are used by device specific software.

  * DEVICE specific software
  
    * roccatDEVICEcontrol
  
      A console application mainly meant as helper for background tasks.
      For basic usage information on roccatDEVICEcontrol please read the manpage.
    
    * roccatDEVICEconfig
    
      Graphical user interfaces to modify the profiles of your devices. You
      should find them in the settings folder of your window manager, or you can
      call them from the console.
      
* Notes on Macro handling

  * Windows drivers store their macros in folders like these:
  
    "%ProgramFiles%\ROCCAT\Arvo Keyboard\config\macro.ini"
    %APPDATA%\ROCCAT\Kone\config\macro.ini
    "%ProgramFiles%\ROCCAT\Kone[+] Mouse\config\Preset_sequence.dat"
    "%ProgramFiles%\ROCCAT\Kova[+] Mouse\config\Kova_sequence.dat"
    "%ProgramFiles%\ROCCAT\Pyra Mouse\config\Pyra_sequence.dat"
    
    I'm providing a unified method of storing and handling macros.
    So you can use a single macro with any device you want without the need for
    defining it in multiple applications.
    
* Known issues

  * If you get annoying SHIFT_L key events when entering keys in DEVICEconfig
    you might have a video application like xine running which tries to disable
    the screensaver in the most stupid way. You have to switch off this
    functionality or close the culprit.
    
  * If some key events don't show up in DEVICEconfig then you might have
    software like xbindkeys running. You have to turn off these tools for
    editing keys or macros in DEVICEconfig. Another possibility is that my
    translation table is missing some keys (in fact at this time i only support
    a standard 105-keys keyboard)
